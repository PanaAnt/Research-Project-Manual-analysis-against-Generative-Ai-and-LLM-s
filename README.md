# A comparative analysis on the performance of LLM's/Generative Ai and ML models in python against manual analysis

## **Researchers:**                    
**Panayiotis Antoniou**~Role: Coder Scraper and Analyst for English Reviews                     
*Huy Khuat*~Role: Scraper and analyst for English Reviews         
*An Khanh Hoang*~Role: Coder Scraper and Analyst for Vietnamese Reviews  
*Nguyen Vu Viet Anh*~Role: Scraper and analyst for Vietnamese Reviews

## **Supervisors:**  
*Dr. Ana Canhoto*  
*Dr. Mike Perkins*  

### **Aims**:
  1. To see how well the models perform against a human analyser 
  2. Determine where the models go wrong and why it struggles in those situations
  3. How this can be applied to the real world and the impacts it may have
     
These aims are discussed in greater detail on Posters designed by me and my colleagues that I worked along side with for this research. (A pdf or image file may be shared for the poster I created later on)  

**Important Note:** Code to do with the vietnamese reviews does not belong to me and belongs to **An Khanh Hoang** (I currently do not have her github repo link,, but if I get permission to share the link to her repo, I will do so) 

A Report written (discussing the aims and much more) by me will be linked in this repository (potentially) when it is completed regarding my research and code that I have written.
